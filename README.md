# uber_da_submit


If the code in my github repository is used for inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue all the loss caused by that.
I still have another public repository - uber(Previously, I committed my code in this repository, so the committed time in this repository should be earlier).

Just an contractor's take home interview(A Chinese, he mentioned this was just a contractor's position, so no recruiter or hiring committee was involved. I found this opportunity on a Chinese forum I mentioned before, he posted that opportunity, but no application link, no job descriptionn or other stuff(Usually, I will not do that take home interview, but I have to find a job as soon as possible at that moment, because of the limitation of the unemployment days, and that job opportunity was posted on that forum(I am not sure whether this is for other purposes or not.)), I just sent him my resume directly(email), no job description, even though for interview questions, no Uber logo, so I am not sure whether he is an employee of Uber or not, just my concern, I couldn't find his LinkedIn profile, because this is a job opportunity, so I think I can take a try. I asked him later, he just replied he understood my concern, finally I was not selected for this position. Hopefully, that is not a fraud.), I asked before, I can publish my code.
