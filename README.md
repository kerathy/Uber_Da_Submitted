# uber_da_submit


If the code in my github repository is used for inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue all the loss caused by that.
I still have another public repository - uber(Previously, I committed my code in this repository, so the committed time in this repository should be earlier).

Just an contractor's take home interview(A Chinese, he mentioned this was just a contractor's position, so no recruiter or hiring committee is involved. I found this opportunity on a forum, he posted that opportunity, but no application link or other stuff, I just sent him my resume directly(email).), I asked before, I can publish my code.
