# uber_da_submit


If the code in my github repository is used for inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue all the loss caused by that.
I still have another public repository - uber(Previously, I committed my code in this repository, so the committed time in this repository should be earlier).

Just an contractor's take home interview(A Chinese, he mentioned this was just a contractor's position, so no recruiter or hiring committee is involved. I found this opportunity on a Chinese forum I mentioned before, he posted that opportunity, but no application link or other stuff, I just sent him my resume directly(email), no job description, even though for interview questions, no uber logo, so I am not sure whether he is an uber employee or not, just my concern, I couldn't find hid LinkedIn profile, because this is a job opportunity, so I think I can take a try. I asked him later, he just replied he answered my concern, finally I was not selected for this position. Hopefully, that is not a fraud.), I asked before, I can publish my code.
