# uber_da_submit


If the code in my GitHub repository is used for any inappropriate purposes, I reserve the right to pursue all losses caused by that.

I have another public repository: Uber. I previously committed my code to this repository, so the commit time should be earlier than the time listed below.

It's just a contractor's take-home assignment. The interviewer is Chinese; he mentioned this was just a contractor's data analyst position, so no recruiter or hiring committee was involved. I found this opportunity on the Chinese forum I mentioned earlier; he posted that opportunity, but there was no application link, no job description, or other stuff. Usually, I would not do this kind of take-home interview, but I needed to find a job as soon as possible at that time due to the unemployment days limit, and that job opportunity was posted on that forum. I am not sure whether this is for other purposes or not. I just sent him my resume via email; there was no job description, and there was no Uber logo on the interview questions. So I am not sure if he is an employee of Uber or not; that is just my concern. I couldn't find his LinkedIn profile, but since this is a job opportunity, I think I can give it a try. I asked him later, and he just replied that he understood my concern. Finally, I was not selected for this position. Hopefully, that is not a fraud. He previously replied that I could publish my code.

I just uploaded Uber Questions.pdf today; in fact, I emailed Uber Questions.html to that person on <img width="163" alt="submitted time" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33749919/183723671-c7c3dc78-6be4-4238-be40-5ac0120686bf.png">

The contents are the same as the files I committed to this repository; I just put them together. I just converted the html file to a pdf file and uploaded it to the Github repository.
